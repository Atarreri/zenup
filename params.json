Emerging poets publish poetry online and publishers save them in content management systems, programs that strip poems and lock them in complex software. We don't have an open format to publish poetry on the web.\r\n\r\nZenup allows you to write poetry using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to a [language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) understood by modern browsers on desktop, mobile, and web.\r\n\r\nZenup is free software, available under a BSD-style open source license. It comprises of two things: 1) a plain text formatting syntax and 2) a tool written in Javascript (the language of the web) to convert plain text format to HTML5. The goal is that poems should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been consumed by content management systems. \r\n\r\nThe best way to get a feel for the  formatting syntax is simply to look at a Zenup-formatted poem, below.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n---\r\ntitle: You May Forget\r\nauthor: Sappho\r\ncountry: Greece\r\nyear: 600/500 bc\r\ngender: female\r\ntags:\r\n-  time\r\n-  love\r\n-  lyric\r\n-  memory\r\n---\r\nYou may forget but\r\nlet me tell you\r\nthis: someone in\r\nsome future time\r\nwill think of us.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## SYNTAX\r\n\r\nThe syntax is inspired from Markdown and YAML. Unlike Markdown, Zenup preserves whitespace \"as-is\", a necessity to preserve the poem's visual semantics.\r\n\r\nThere are two parts to the syntax: poem and metadata.\r\n\r\n**POEM**\r\n\r\n[Plain Text](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text) is still an excellent format supported by all editors by default.\r\n\r\n```\r\nEvery time I say \"joy,\" joyous thing,\r\nyou will know that I am talking about you,\r\nfor you are the joy of all joyous beauty\r\nand the joy of all joyous and beautiful pleasures,\r\n```\r\n\r\n**METADATA**\r\n\r\nYAML, a humanly readable format, supports storing metadata inline.\r\n\r\nMetadata will be curated *inline* for describing the poem,  to inform humans and machines of semantic data for further analysis.\r\n\r\n```\r\n---\r\ntitle: You May Forget\r\nauthor: Sappho\r\ncountry: Greece\r\nyear: 600/500 bc\r\ngender: female\r\ntags:\r\n-  time\r\n-  love\r\n-  lyric\r\n-  memory\r\n---\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote the \"space\" after \":\" and \"-\". Note the `---` before and after the metadata. \r\n\r\nFilenames are saved as `first-name-last-name-first-six-words-of-title.txt` OR `first-name-last-name-first-six-words-of-opening-line.txt`. \r\n\r\nAn optional `.zenup` file extension can be used for tools that understands this format.\r\n\r\n**FORMATTING**\r\n\r\n- `*italics*`\r\n- `**bold**`\r\n- `emdash--`\r\n\r\n**RULES**\r\n\r\n- A poem should have a title. If a title doesn't exist, the first or last line can be used as title.\r\n- A poem should have an author's name (first, last, or both)\r\n- Tags are optional, though a minimum of three tags are recommended.\r\n\r\n## EDITORS\r\n\r\nPlaintext format is supported by default in *all* major editors: notepad, textedit, [iAWriter](http://www.iawriter.com/mac/), MS Word, etc., However, there are two important steps\r\n\r\n1. Files must be saved with an extension \".txt\" or \".zenup\"\r\n1. Files must be saved in [UTF-8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) 'encoding'-- a setting available as options in the 'save as' file-dialog. \r\n\r\nSaving a file in UTF-8 is a necessary, important step to preserve foreign-language characters, accent quotes, across machines so humands can read.\r\n\r\n## SCRIPTS\r\n\r\nZenup comes with free tools written in Python and Javascript, to convert poems from Zenup format to HTML5 with CSS3, or a printer-friendly page.\r\n\r\nWriting a tool in other languages should be trivial, given that YAML and Plaintext are standard formats.\r\n\r\n## STATUS\r\n\r\nThis is a working draft.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Zenup is being used by [Poetroid](https://github.com/poetroid), an open platform to disover poetry together. **35,000 poems** were restored from the public domain using this format.\r\n\r\n## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\r\n\r\nThank you, [Ata Moharreri](https://twitter.com/AtaMoharreri), for your feedback in moving poetry forward.\r\n\r\nThank you, Sreeharsha Mudivarti, for implementing the early prototypes.\r\n\r\n## Copyright & License\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2013, Priyatam Mudivarti.\r\n\r\nZenup is free software, available under a BSD-style open source license.
